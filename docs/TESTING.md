# Testing in Anor

## Current Status

As of now, Anor does not have a formal testing suite. We recognize the importance of testing and plan to implement it in the near future.

## Future Plans

We aim to add:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End-to-end tests
- Performance tests


We welcome contributions to our testing efforts.
